                Happy February, love! As we welcome this month, I wish that it will be a good one, better than the last. I hope na hindi 
                tayo masyadong mag-away ulit, mahal ko, and that we become even happier together. Because this month is not just an 
                ordinary month, this is your special month, so it is very special to me as well. I want to make you feel special each day 
                sa abot ng makakaya ko. This month may be filled with uncertainties, but I hope na we face them together with love and a 
                smile. We have a lot to celebrate this month, and I would love to celebrate each day with you. <br><br>

                I also want to greet you <b>a Happy Assurance Day and Happy Monthsary!!! </b>If we think about it, we’ve been together 
                for so long, yet it still feels a bit short. We’ve experienced so many things since the day we became involved with each 
                other, but there’s still a lot more to learn, experience, and improve on. On our 20th monthsary, I want to assure you na 
                no matter what we go through, hindi ako mawawala sa tabi mo, and I’ll continue loving you with the same intensity and even
                more than that. This month, this year, we have lots of plans and goals we want to achieve, and we know it won’t be easy 
                for us. Maraming what-ifs, maraming pagod, maraming pagtitipid. Ang wish ko lang for us is a little more patience and 
                trust, with each other and within ourselves. Kahit gaano kahirap, as long as we’re together, kakayanin natin, lalo na if 
                we have strong faith and continue to support each other. I assure you that what we’ll receive will be better than what 
                we’ve been asking for, and igu-guide tayo ni Lord all the time. <br><br>

                So let’s not give up. Walang susuko, walang maghihiwalay, walang sobrang mag-aaway. We’ll get tired, broken, and confused 
                sometimes, but let’s always look at the bigger picture before deciding things. Lahat ng pagtitiis at efforts natin will pay
                 off. I’m sure of that. So let’s hold onto each other tighter. This is the time when we need each other more, to do our best
                  and not give up. Pangakong kasama mo ako hanggang sa maabot natin ang mga plano natin. I love you so much. <br><br>
